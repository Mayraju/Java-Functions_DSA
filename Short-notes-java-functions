## how to sort the matrix in Java

1. In the matrix, we sort the values based on the index value, as it treats everything as a single array

let matrix = [[2,1],[9,19],[3,14]]  --> i want to sort the matrix based on the arr[I][0] the sorting will look like this

**Arrays. sort( matrix, new Comparator<int[]>(){
     public int compare(int[] a,int[] b){
           return Integer.compare(a[0],b[0]);
     }
})**
