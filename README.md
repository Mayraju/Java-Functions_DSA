# Java-Functions_DSA

**This is for how to use some in-built functionality in DSA for fast problem-solving**

## Some of the examples include
1. how to sort the matrix
2. how to count the no of times in the array
3. how to convert Hashset directly into ArrayList or list
4. how to convert a string to a character array
5. how to convert StringBuilder to string
6. how to clear or remove elements from the Java frameworks like ArrayList, list, HashSet, hashmap, priority queue, stack, queue
7. how to iterate the Hashmap
8. how to fill the default values in Multi-Dimensional arrays like 2-D and,3-D arrays.




**Many more functionality will come, stay tuned**
